Hey Chris,

See? My steadfastness paid off. :)

Looks like a win/win situation.
You can link to http://byteful.com/blog/ and list the credit as  
Byteful Travel, yep.

Hey also, I just had an idea. What if you made a menubar menu that  
showed the lyrics of the song inside menu itself when you clicked it?  
Or maybe just a button in the menubar that toggled the lyric window.



best,
